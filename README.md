# Baltic Sea SST Analysis

## ðŸ“– Overview
Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Trends: Use the BSH satellite SST dataset (monthly means of Baltic Sea sea surface temperature, 1990â€“present)gdk.gdi-de.org.

Download the CSV file (e.g. from BSH) and load it into Pandas. Compute the annual mean SST for each year and plot a time series (line chart) of yearly mean SST to reveal long-term trends. Compute the linear temperature trend (Â°C/decade) via regression. Also analyze seasonality: create a boxplot or line chart showing the distribution of SST by month.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Line chart of annual mean SST vs. year, with trend line.

- Boxplot (or violin plot) of monthly SST to show seasonal cycle.

- Optionally, annotate anomalies (e.g. highlight 2022). 

Calculations: annual averages, trend slope (e.g. using numpy.polyfit or scipy.stats.linregress), seasonal statistics.
